# Simplwork: An attempt to fix the hiring process

This is the REST backend of a website I built a while ago. The aim of the webiste was to fix the broken hiring process. 
What this website would do, is the user would make a profile and based on the profile they would automatically be applied to jobs instantly.
While on the employer's side, as soon as they made a job posting, they would instantly get potential candidates they can interview.
All of this was supposed to be for blue collar jobs, with the aim of expand to white collar jobs.
This was my first (and sadly last :( ) iteration on this (atleast in terms of a website for blue-collar jobs). I spent a lot of time making it and no one was interested once I made it, so I just ditched this.
